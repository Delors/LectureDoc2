/* LAYER: behavior (THE TOP PRIORITY LAYER) */

/* 
    This file - in combination with the imported css files - represents the 
    very core of LectureDoc's css. It primarily defines css properties 
    directly related to the core functionality of LectureDoc. I.e., how slides 
    as a whole are displayed in the different modes. The CSS classes defined in 
    this file are (often) used by LectureDoc's API. Hence, any changes here, may 
    require code changes in other CSS and/or JavaScript files.
    
    Styling related to the content of slides is defined elsewhere.
