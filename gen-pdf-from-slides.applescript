# Converts an HTML file to PDF using "Safari's" "Save to PDF..." Functionality.
# Reads from the command line the path of the HTML document.
#
# Example: 	osascript gen-pdf-from-slides.applescript ~/Sites/delors.github.io/lab-shell/folien.rst.html
#
# Remark: 		Safari's "Export as PDF" generates PDFs which does not honor 
# 				media settings and we don't want that!
#
# Helpful URLs (for the development):
# 				"Keycodes:"    http://macbiblioblog.blogspot.com/2014/12/key-codes-for-function-and-special-keys.html
# 				"Inspired by:" https://www.macscripter.net/t/scripting-a-full-path-from-standard-save-as-dialog-box/75178/4
#
# Version:		1.0.2
#				Aug. 2024
#				Michael Eichberg
#
# Further Ideas/TODOs:
#				- Ensure that a Generic Printer is selected to get colored PDFs
#				  (Up until then a printer which supports color output has to be the
#				  default printer)
#				- Ensure that "Print Backgrounds" is enabled to get colored Boxes!
#
# Dependencies/Tested with:
# 				(Does not work any longer due to changes to the "Save as" Textfield: Safari 17.3, 17.4, 18.2)
#				Safari 26
